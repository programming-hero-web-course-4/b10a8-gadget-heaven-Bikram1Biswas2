# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

3- List of React Fundamental concepts used in the project
=>Here's a list of essential React fundamental concepts that you have implemented in your project:

a-Components: Breaking down the UI into reusable components (SideMenu, CardsContainer, Card, etc.) is a fundamental React concept that promotes modularity.

b-State Management: Utilizing useState to manage local component states like cart, wishList, and categories.

c-Context API: Sharing data (such as cart and wishlist items) across components without prop-drilling by using React's Context API.

d-Props: Passing data between components through props (e.g., passing products to Cards and gadget to Card).

e-Routing with React Router: Setting up client-side routing to handle navigation and dynamic URLs (e.g., /category/:products), and displaying different components based on routes.

f-Lifecycle with useEffect: Using useEffect to fetch data on component mount or when dependencies change, handling side effects within functional components.

g-Conditional Rendering: Displaying different UI elements based on conditions (e.g., showing "No items in this category" if the filtered products are empty).

h-Error Handling: Managing errors during data fetching and displaying fallback messages for a better user experience.

i-Event Handling: Implementing events like onClick in components (e.g., adding items to the cart or wishlist).

j-Toast Notifications: Providing feedback to the user for actions like adding items to the cart or wishlist, using react-toastify for real-time notifications.

k-These concepts form the foundation of a dynamic and interactive React application, allowing for modularity, reusability, and enhanced user experience.

 5-5features of your website/project
 =>Here are five key features of your project:

i>Category-Based Filtering: Users can browse products by categories from the SideMenu, allowing for an organized and focused browsing experience.

ii>Add to Cart and Wishlist Functionality: Users can add products to their cart or wishlist, with real-time updates in the UI and toast notifications to confirm actions.

iii>Dynamic Product Details: Clicking on a product card displays detailed information, enhancing the user's ability to make informed decisions.

iv>Contextual Data Sharing: The Context API shares cart and wishlist data across components, so items and counts update seamlessly across the site.

v>Responsive Routing with Error Handling: React Router provides smooth navigation between sections, with custom error pages for unrecognized URLs, ensuring a reliable user experience.
